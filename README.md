# Un/PiStorm
An Amiga FPGA Replacement for the Pi400

Un/PiStorm is the inverse of the PiStorm. Instead of providing a bridge to allow a Raspberry Pi run inside of a real Amiga, this allows an FPGA to run like the chipset of a real Amiga for the Pi400. This provides possibly one of the fastest AND cheapest ways to get up and running with a modern Amiga. it uses the same 'interface' as PiStorm and as such should work with all existing implementations including running Mushashi under Linux and having all the bonus features therein, or running Emu68 baremetal with all the Pi's potential under the control of AmigaOS.

## Planned Features
- 100% open source everything
- compatible with PiStorm
- offloads Amiga ECS or OCS chipset
- up to 8MB of chip RAM built-in
- HDMI audio and video output
